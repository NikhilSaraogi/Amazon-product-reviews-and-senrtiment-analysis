# Amazon-product-reviews-and-senrtiment-analysis
Online stores like Amazon provide a website for consumers to express their opinions about different items. Since then, it has been established that buying online, 90% of consumers are testing different websites channels to determine the quality of their purchase. To evaluate the text data and then extract the sentiment element from that the field of sentiment analysis is frequently used. From user ratings, suggestions, recommendations and messages, online business websites produce a massive volume of textual data every day. Product reviews are becoming more important with the evolution of traditional brick and mortar retail stores to online shopping. Consumers are posting reviews directly on product pages in real time. With the vast amount of consumer reviews, this creates an opportunity to see how the market reacts to a specific product. I am  assuming that sample size of 30K examples are sufficient to represent the entire population of sales/reviews and  that the information I find in the text reviews of each product will be rich enough to train a sentiment analysis classifier with accuracy (hopefully) > 70%.
